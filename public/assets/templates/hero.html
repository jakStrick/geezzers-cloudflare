				B. Franklin understood some shit we seem to have lost sight of
				today. He understood that a republic requires an educated and
				engaged citizenry—geezzers and all—to survive. Today, we face a
				crisis in civic knowledge that a couple of geezzers hope to help
				restore. Yup, just two old geezzers who've watched too much TV,
				played one too many video games, drunk too much wine, coffee, and
				whiskey, and sat back and watched this country devolve into a crap
				fest while we were too busy having fun. But lucky for you, we feel
				we still have some thoughts—our geezer ideas—to share and hope
				they're still relevant.

				<strong>Geezzers' Warning:</strong> One of the easiest ways for a
				politician to get your vote is to promise free shit. Think about
				it... why wouldn't it be? And have you ever asked yourself what does
				"free" really mean? Who's paying for all this free stuff?
			</p>

			<p>
				<strong>Idea Behind The Geezzers' Blog:</strong> To explore the
				mechanics of American government our constitutional republic—the
				three branches, their checks and balances, and how they work. Our
				goal is to make these complex systems understandable through plain
				language and geezzers' analysis.
			</p>

			<p>
				<strong>What you'll find here:</strong> We provide simple
				explanation of our constitutional republic in Geezzer fashion giving
				Geezzer insight to help bring a little balance to the world around
				us and help put things into perspective.
			</p>

			<p>
				<strong>What you won't find here:</strong> Hate speech, personal
				attacks, or conspiracy theories (like QAnon, Kings and TDS etc.). We
				can disagree about geezzer stuff civilly. We've been disagreeing
				with each other since Adam and Eve but let's remain civil.
			</p>

			<p class="mission-cta">
				Whether you're a political newcomer or a fellow old-timer, join a
				couple geezzers talking about things they can remember. Because
				understanding our constitutional republic isn't just academic—it's
				essential to preserving it for everyone.
